    <h2>i am a self-taught <br/>front-end web developer <br/>from london</h2>
            <p>
              I have experience of creating responsive interactive websites by hand-coding HTML, CSS, and JQuery. I am passionate about design and alongside my technical ability, I can create innovative interfaces which allow ease of usability. I follow many online
            blogs and front-end news sites to keep updated with current standards and new developments in an ever-changing field. Teaching myself to code while working full-time has required me to be proactive, a fast learner, and efficient
            in my methods of execution.</p>
