ABOUT

information:

I am a self-taught front-end web developer from London.

I have always had a keen interest code and started my coding journey using WYSIWYG tools to create websites.  I found these tools were too limited leading me to wanting increased control over my projects, MY ability to absorb information fast has meant I have gained an increased knowledge and experience to hand code my projects resulting in me developing the skills required to produce responsive interactive websites. 

I follow many online blogs and front-end news sites to keep up with current standards and new developments in an ever changing field in order to complete projects.
